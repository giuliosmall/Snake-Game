# Snake Game 🐍

Feeling nostalgic for retro games? No worries, in this repository you will find a `main.py` file that allows you to dive into your childhood memories and play the most famous video games of all times: the Snake Game 🐍 <br/>But don't leave me yet because there are many more things you need to know and discover and you will be required to give some specific parameters to the program.

If you run the program, executing the main file with: `$ python main.py -u playername` a window with a small cubic segment moving around appears on your screen, and that's your time to play!

> Note: the project requires the following modules to run: Turtle, argparse, sqlite3, 

You can use the arrow keys of your computer keyboard to move the snake around and try to eat the pieces of food in its path so it can grow in length. For each piece of food the snake eats, and additional point is added to your score but as in the real game, every time the snake collides with the walls of the window or its own tail, then it's GAME OVER 👾❌ 

Don't worry, you can play as many times as you want and your score will be saved together with your competitors' ones so you can always check your ranking and try to beat their score! We have also provided you with the possibility to personalise your game, choosing the colour of the backgorund or the snake, and even the shape of the food, but don't worry I will exlpain you everything step by step!
